## Starting a Private Session

![PrivateSession](https://github.com/kanmatthew/Matt-test-docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/start_private_session.png?raw=true)

2. Press **Private Session** within the drop down menu to begin listening without sharing or recording your history.  

![PrivateSession2](https://github.com/kanmatthew/Matt-test-docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/start_private_session2.png?raw=true)

A blue lock will appear next to your profile picture when you have successfully began the Private Session.

3. Press **Private Session** a second time to end the session.

Alternatively, you can start a private session by clicking on the **triple dotted** button at the top left corner of the web player and the option is under **File**.

**_Note_**: A **private session** only hides your activity for 6 hours. Also, if you exit the application while in **private session** mode, you will have to set it again when you relaunch the application.

## Listening to Music Offline

1. Download a playlist you would like to listen to while offline. Successfully downloaded playlists will have a green arrow next to the playlist's name.
