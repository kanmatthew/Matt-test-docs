# Made a Mistake When Creating Playlist?

1. If you accidentally hit a wrong keystroke while naming your playlist or you want to edit the description you've given, click the name of the playlist in your sidebar.  

![EditPlaylist](https://github.com/kanmatthew/Matt-test-docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/editplaylist1.png?raw=true)

2. After you click on the on the playlist you would like to edit, you will see the following:  

![EditPlaylist2](https://github.com/kanmatthew/Matt-test-docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/editplaylist2.png?raw=true)

_Now you can change the name of the playlist or its description_.
