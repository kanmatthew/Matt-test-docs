The instructions written on the markdown files located inside the docs folder along with the index.md file in the repository's home folder will help a new user to Spotify get started with the application and its usages.

In order to re-arrange the sidebar and its different markdown files, we went into each of the files we were using and changed the "nav_order" at the head of the file. For files we didn't want showing up in the sidebar, we changed the "nav_order" to "nav_exclude: true", in case we need to refer back to the original files for more information.

On the introduction page, we included a hyperlink to Spotify's homepage with the word Spotify in the first step. We did this by containing the word we wished to include a hyperlink to inside square brackets followed by parentheses with the link we wanted to redirect the user to. Setting up the application is a prerequisite to following the instructions we laid out in our manual.

For each of our steps in all the procedures, we bolded keywords to highlight to users the important things to look for when following the instructions. We did this by either using underscores around keywords or asterisks. 

Because graphics are universally understood, we tried to include as many graphics as we believed necessary for anyone new to the Spotify Web Player App. We gave each of the graphics an alternative text description in case the image doesn't load properly, this way the user will at least know what the intended image was to represent. This time though, instead of hyperlinking to another site, we followed the alternative text in square brackets with parentheses that contained a link to where we stored our images in the respository.
