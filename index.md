# Introduction
{: .fs-9 }

This instruction set will guide you in the use of Spotify's lesser known functions.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

These instructions cover how to recover a deleted playlist, how to find songs catered to your taste, and how to start a private session on the Spotify application. Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service with access to millions of songs and other media content from artists around the world. Spotify is the most popular global audio streaming subscription service because of its basic user interface across all platforms, its streaming quality, and its music sharing capabilities.

This manual is intended for users with basic computer skills and little to no experience with Spotify.

For these sets of instructions, we will be using the latest version of the Spotify Web Player. The Spotify homepage is automatically up-to-date with the latest desktop version available, so there will be no need to worry what version you'll be downloading. 

## Prerequisites

To follow these instructions, you will need:

* Mac, Windows, or Linux Operating System.
* Spotify.com Account.
* Spotify Web Player.
* Basic Computer Skills.
* Internet Browser.
